# My Personal Homepage (Second Project)

For my second web/ frontend project, I initially built everything from scratch using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. While this approach was excellent for learning and understanding the fundamentals, I reached a point where I realized that to advance further, integrating additional tools like frameworks and libraries would be essential. To fully develop and polish the website, a fresh start with a clean, structured approach using these advanced tools would be more effective. The experience from this project has been invaluable, but transitioning to modern development practices will better support the creation of a complete and robust website.
